# Automation Task

This is a repository for practicing Behavior Driven Development (BDD) using the Cucumber framework.

## What is BDD?

BDD is a software development approach that focuses on defining the behavior of a system in terms of user stories or scenarios. These scenarios are written in a plain language format that can be understood by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. BDD helps to align the development team with the business goals and ensure that the software meets the needs of its users.
